## 🗓️ 120-Day Master Learning Plan (Structured for Success)

[cite_start]This plan is structured to take you from a foundational understanding to solving competitive-level problems, comparable to challenging courses like **MIT OCW 6.851**[cite: 101].

### **Phase 1: Core Foundation (Days 1–20)**

[cite_start]**Goal:** Master core DSA + patterns used in **80% of FAANG interviews**[cite: 96].
* [cite_start]**Daily Routine:** Learn 1 Topic and solve 3-5 Problems on that pattern[cite: 96].
* [cite_start]**Topics Include:** Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Linked List (Fast & Slow), Stack/Queue Basics, Binary Search, Heaps, Hashing, Recursion/Backtracking, Graph Basics (BFS, DFS, Union-Find), and DP 1D/2D[cite: 97].

### **Phase 2: Intermediate + Interview Level (Days 21–60)**

[cite_start]**Goal:** Cover all standard + tricky topics asked by Google, Amazon, etc[cite: 98].
* [cite_start]**Daily Routine:** Learn 1 Deep Topic, solve 3 Medium + 2 Hard problems, and participate in 1 Contest weekly (LC/CF)[cite: 98].
* [cite_start]**Schedule Highlights:** Bit Manipulation, Tries, String Matching (KMP, Z, RK), 0-1 BFS, DP Bitmasking, Monotonic Stack/Queue, LRU/LFU Cache (Design)[cite: 98, 99].

### **Phase 3: Advanced + MIT Level + Competitive (Days 61–100)**

[cite_start]**Goal:** Prepare for advanced roles, competitive programming, and topics seen in MIT 6.851 equivalence[cite: 99].
* [cite_start]**Focus:** Solve 2 Advanced Problems/Day and 3x Weekly CF/AtCoder Contest[cite: 99].
* [cite_start]**Core Topics:** Heavy-Light Decomposition, Centroid Decomposition, Persistent Segment Tree, Mo's Algorithm, Suffix Array/Automaton, **2-SAT Solver**, **Min-Cost Max-Flow** (Dinic's), **Game Theory** (Grundy, Nim), and Geometry[cite: 99, 100].

### **Phase 4: Final Stretch (Days 101–120)**

[cite_start]**Focus:** Revision, Mocks, and Company-Specific Preparation[cite: 100].
* [cite_start]Re-solve weak topics and practice FAANG past questions (Blind 75, Google Tag LC)[cite: 100].
* [cite_start]Conduct 2 Mock Interviews per week[cite: 100].

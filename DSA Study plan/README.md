| 27 | Greedy Algorithms and Sorting Variations |
| 28 | Monotonic Stack and Queue |
| 29 | Matrix and Grid Problems |
| 30 | Stack Applications (Largest Rectangle, Histogram) |
| 31 | Sliding Puzzle / BFS with Compression |
| 32 | Randomized Algorithms (Reservoir Sampling, QuickSelect) |
| 33 | System Design: LRU / LFU Cache Implementation |
| 34 | Practice Test 2 |
| 35–55 | Mixed Practice (Reinforcement + Revision) |
| 56–60 | Revision and Mock Tests (3 Mocks Recommended) |

## Phase 3: Advanced, MIT-Level, and Competitive (Days 61–100)

**Goal:** Reach research and competitive programming standards equivalent to MIT 6.851 and ICPC Regionals.

**Focus:**
- Solve two advanced problems daily
- Participate in three competitive contests per week (Codeforces / AtCoder)

**Core Topics:**

- Heavy-Light Decomposition  
- Centroid Decomposition  
- Persistent Segment Tree  
- Mo’s Algorithm  
- Square Root Decomposition  
- Suffix Array, Suffix Automaton, and Trie Optimization  
- Dynamic Programming on Trees / Rerooting Techniques  
- Graph Coloring and Bipartite Checking  
- 2-SAT Problem Solving  
- Min-Cost Max-Flow (Edmonds–Karp, Dinic)  
- Game Theory (Grundy Numbers, Nim Game)  
- Computational Geometry (Convex Hull, Sweep Line)  
- String Hashing, Rabin–Karp, and Aho–Corasick Automata  
- Offline Queries, Virtual Trees, and Euler Tour Techniques  

---

## Phase 4: Final Stretch (Days 101–120)

**Goal:** Consolidate knowledge, strengthen weak areas, and simulate real interview environments.

**Focus Areas:**
- Re-solve problems from weak topics
- Attempt FAANG company-specific past questions (Blind 75, Google/Amazon tags on LeetCode)
- Take two mock interviews per week (use Pramp, Interviewing.io)
- Conduct weekly review of mistakes and missed patterns

---

## Tools and Platforms

- **LeetCode:** Use Tag Filters (Top 100 Liked, Google, Amazon)
- **Codeforces:** Practice in Gym or by problem rating (1300–2000+)
- **GeeksforGeeks:** Topic-wise problem sets for revision
- **Notion / Google Sheets:** Track topics, problems, and performance over time

---

## Optional Advanced Learning (MIT-Level Enhancement)

- Explore MIT OpenCourseWare:  
  - 6.006 — Introduction to Algorithms  
  - 6.046 — Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
  - 6.851 — Advanced Data Structures  

- Join study communities and mentorship groups:  
  - Striver Discord  
  - AlgoZenith  
  - Codeforces Editorial Discussions  

- Participate in peer mock interviews and discussions:
  - Pramp  
  - Interviewing.io  

---

## Success Formula

**Rule:**  
1 Topic + 5 Problems per Day × 120 Days = FAANG-Level DSA Proficiency

**Outcome:**  
Strong algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and optimization skill set comparable to MIT 6.006–6.851 level.
